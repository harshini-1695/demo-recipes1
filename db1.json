            "Preheat oven to 425Â°F.\n            Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard.\n            With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears (this keeps the asparagus from being all.\n            Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.\n            Sprinkle with salt.\n            With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.\n            Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.\n            They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.\n            The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.\n            They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.",
